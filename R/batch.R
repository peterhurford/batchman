batches <- structure(list(), class = "no_batches")

## `batch` is where all the action happens.  `batch` is a functional -- it takes a function as
## an argument (among many other arguments) and returns a function.  The returned function is
## a modified version of the original function that will process inputs in batch.

#' batch maps a function to a batched version of that function.
#'
#' @param batch_fn function. The method to batch over.
## We need to know what keys will be the ones that will be batched versus the ones that
## are not to be batched.  For example, for `mean`, we would want to batch the vector of numbers
## but we would not like to batch along the optional `na.rm` argument.
#' @param keys vector. The names of the keys within the function to batch.
#'   Can be "..." if one is batching a splat function with no keys.
## A splitting strategy is a methodology to split up the inputs.  Right now the default one
## that comes with batchman seems to handle every scenario well enough, and I've never come up
## with a reason to roll a custom splitting_strategy.  But I leave it to you to decide!
#' @param splitting_strategy function. The strategy used to split up inputs.
#'   Leave NULL to use the versatile default splitting strategy.
## The combination strategy is about how to recombine the inputs once they are processed in
## batch.  The default one will handle pretty much anything, but the trade-off is that doing so
## is slow.  So it's a good idea to pass a more specific combination_strategy if you can.
#' @param combination_strategy function. The strategy used to recombine batches.
#'   Defaults to class-agnostic combination.
#' @param size numeric. The size of the packets. Default 50.
#' @param trycatch logical. Whether to wrap the function in a tryCatch block.
#'   Can be used to store and retrieve partial progress on an error.
#' @param batchman.verbose logical. Whether or not to announce progress by printing dots.
#' @param stop logical. Whether trycatch should stop if an error is raised.
#' @param retry integer. The number of times to retry on error. 0 for no retrying.
#' @param sleep integer. Time in seconds to sleep between batches.
#' @param parallel logical. Use parallel::mclapply to execute your batches. Incompatible with retry.
#' @param ncores integer. Number of cores to use if parallel is set to true. Notice that it doesn't
#'   work on windows.
#' @param key vector. Same as /code{keys}.
#' @return a batched version of the passed function.
#' @examples
#'   batched_identity <- batch(identity, "x", combination_strategy = c, size = 10)
#'   batched_identity(seq(100))
#'   # Does identity, but in batches of 10.
